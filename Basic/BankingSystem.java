Real-world Problem Scenario: Online Banking Transaction System

Problem Statement: Design a Java program for an online banking transaction system that utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and exception handling to ensure secure and efficient financial transactions.

Description:

In this scenario, we are tasked with developing a Java application for an online banking system that adheres to Object-Oriented Programming principles and effectively manages exceptions. The system should support various operations such as account balance checking, fund transfers, and transaction history retrieval.

Requirements and Object-Oriented Design:

1. User Account:
   - Create a 'User' class with attributes like 'name', 'accountNumber', 'balance', and 'transactionHistory'.
   - Use encapsulation to ensure that account details are accessed only through methods, not directly.

2. Bank Account Types:
   - Implement different account types, like savings and checking, by using inheritance. Create subclasses for each type, inheriting common attributes and behaviors from a base 'Account' class.

3. Transactions:
   - Develop a 'Transaction' class that captures transaction details, such as 'date', 'amount', and 'transactionType'.
   - Maintain a transaction history for each account, allowing users to retrieve their transaction history.

4. Exception Handling:
   - Implement custom exceptions like 'InsufficientFundsException' to handle cases where an account balance is insufficient for a transaction.

5. Fund Transfer:
   - Design a method for transferring funds between accounts, which should check for valid account numbers and throw exceptions when necessary.

6. Account Management:
   - Implement methods for depositing and withdrawing money, ensuring proper balance updates and transaction recording.

7. Security:
   - Use access modifiers (public, private, protected) to control access to data and methods, maintaining the security of user accounts.

8. Input Validation:
   - Implement input validation to handle invalid inputs when performing transactions or managing accounts.

9. User Interface:
   - Create a simple text-based user interface or consider integrating a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the system.

By addressing these requirements and applying OOP principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, you can design a robust and secure online banking system in Java. Exception handling will ensure the system gracefully handles errors and prevents unauthorized or erroneous transactions, enhancing its reliability and security.
